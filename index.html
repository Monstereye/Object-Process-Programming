      <section>
        <p>The Object-Process programming language is a high-level visual programming language that I am developing as part of my PhD studies. As a software developer, it always bugged be that the way we write programs hasn't changed much in the last 30-40 years. IDEs have evolved, interfaces have improved, our screens (we all have more than one now) have become very, VERY big... Yet we are still writing our code in plain text files without using all of the power of the modern interfaces that we have created.</p>

<p>Because of this I created the Object-Process programming language (yes, corny name. If you have a better proposal, please add it to <a href="https://github.com/vainolo/Object-Process-Programming/issues/164">this issue</a>). OPP is based on the graphical language created by my PhD advisor, Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Dori">Dov Dori</a>. I have made some minor changes to the language to make it fully executable, and I'm working hard in the development of an editor and interpreter for the language.</p>

<p>Interested? Learn more in my tutorial. </p>

<p>I'm more than happy to hear your comments, and proposals. This is still a work in progress, so if you find a bug, or an inconsistency in the language, please open an issue and I'll get to it as soon as possible.</p>
